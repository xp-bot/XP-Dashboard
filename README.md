2. Push your changes as commits on your fork.
3. [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/xp-bot/dashboard/compare). Make sure to use a descriptive title and detailed description.
> Please avoid submitting large pull requests with multiple changes as they will be categorically rejected. Always create one pull request per change.

## How to Set Up the Repository

To set up the repository, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and NPM:  
Make sure you have Node.js 16+ and NPM 8+ installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official Node.js website.

2. Pull the Project from GitHub:  
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

3. Install Required Packages:   
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Run the command `npm ci` to install all required packages for the project.

4. Start the Dashboard:  
After the packages are installed, you can start the dashboard by running the appropriate command in your terminal:

  - To boot up the development environment, run the command `npm run dev`.
  - To boot up the production environment, run the command `npm run prod`.

That's it!   
You can now access the dashboard locally by opening it in a web browser. For the development environment, it runs on port 3000, and for the production environment, it runs on port 3838.
