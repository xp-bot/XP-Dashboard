### Why contribute?
Every contributor earns a brand new badge called the Contributor Badge, which will be displayed on your Ranking Card and on our official Discord community.
Additionally, third-party contributions help us maintain this project as we work on XP in our freetime without any commercial profit.
We're also looking to publish more projects as open-source in the future.
Thank you for contributing to XP!
